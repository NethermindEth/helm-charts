# Nitro deployment replaced by nitro-statefulset.yaml for proper persistent storage and scaling
# This file is kept for reference but the StatefulSet is used instead
# The new StatefulSet provides:
# - Proper persistent storage with volumeClaimTemplates
# - Better configuration management through ConfigMaps
# - Enhanced service discovery and scaling capabilities
# - JWT secrets and wallet management
# - Comprehensive probe configurations
# - Support for all nitro chart features
